	      <h3>Establishing the 10-Point Piece</h3>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>Every week, I would commission a director, curator, actor, artist or author to write a short, powerful ‘10-Point Piece’. Focused on an upcoming project, it would surmise its context, cultural significance, and aims and objectives in 10 bullet points. For example, Marianne Elliott could write about the revival of Tony Kushner’s <span class="italics">Angels in America</span> at the National; Stephen Coppel, lead curator of the British Museum’s upcoming show <span class="italics">The American Dream</span> could explain why its themes are more relevant, and resonant, than ever; John Ridley could succinctly outline the shape of his upcoming series <span class="italics">Guerilla</span>, and the approach he has taken in probing a rarely explored side to British black history.</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h3>A weekly Style column</h3>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>Fashion operates in an increasingly febrile sphere that is ripe for rigorous, energetic analysis. Thus, I would suggest expanding <span class="italics">i’s</span> Arts coverage to encompass a weekly Style column, straddling the intersection between fashion, tech, politics and art. Proposed topics might include:
          </li>
	      	<li><span class="italics underline">Why protest is 2017’s most fitting trend:</span> In 2017, fashion has been given an overtly political twist. Trump’s flagrant rhetoric, the divisive narrative sparked by Brexit, and the dominance of a post-truth politics that trades in scandal rather than truth, has proved fertile ground for fashion designers, sparking one of the years biggest trends: the Slogan T-shirt, seen on catwalks everywhere from Paris to New York. Fashion’s broad embrace of politics is, however, riddled with complexity. It shows that younger generations, disengaging from traditional political paradigms, are finding alternate ways to articulate their opinions: through fashion, social media, protesting and art. But Dior’s ‘We Should All Be Feminists’ T-shirt, retailing at $700, signals that, in the eyes of the fashion industry, wearing your heart on your sleeve is a luxury that most people can’t afford.</li>
	      	<li><span class="italics underline">Connectivity and Clothes:</span> In as little as three years, 10 billion items of apparel will be connected to the internet. This will fundamentally alter the relationship that we have with our clothes. Brands will ferociously market the positives (that customers can track the provenance of a garment, easily find out how to recycle it, and get digital styling tips), but the data implications are ominous. As we secrete more information online, and the internet envelops the intimacies of our lives, down to the very contents of our underwear drawers, the granularity of the data being processed, stored, and often sold is unprecedented. Operating in a fluid, capricious online sphere that presents hackers and unknown entities with an ever-expanding surface area, the challenge for the fashion industry will be to maintain a firm, transparent grip on security. The shape of the Internet of Things is still being crafted, but what is for certain is that, as we shift our lives further and further online, the clothes behind our closet doors will be bristling with capabilities that span far beyond just style.</li>
	      </ul>

        <h3>Risen stars to interview rising stars</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I would commission relevant, contemporary names working in and whipping up attention in the arts to interview rising stars in their given fields. Offering a neat sense of symmetry, the pieces would provide a series of unique perspectives into what it is like to work in the creative industries. Examples of ideal pairings would include Phoebe Waller-Bridge speaking to </span>Chewing Gum’s</li> Michaela Coel about television, comedy, and representing sex on-screen, and spoken-word poet Kate Tempest interviewing Warsan Shire, the Young Poet Laureate, about poetry’s recent renaissance, and their mutual influence: South London.</li>
        </ul>

	      <h3>Approaching video with a defined editorial strategy</h3>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>Often, videos appear to have been generated solely to attract users to one piece of content. To combat this problem, with video, I would consciously adopt a clear, concise editorial strategy that finds audiences, and then retains them. For example, I would develop a range of video series, thematically arranged, and pegged around significant cultural events. During the Edinburgh Fringe, <span class="italics">i</span> could commission comedians to film minute-long jokes, which would be run across the website and social media channels. Or, to coincide with Hay Festival’s 30th anniversary, authors could be filmed reading iconic extracts from classic books.</li>
	      	<li>I would also be mindful, however, of the growing desire for immersive, personal video experiences. Exploring the possibilities offered by Facebook Live and 360° video, I would use these mediums to provide readers with immediate visual insights into exhibitions and openings.</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h3>Concise, concentrated podcasts</h3>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>Combining the intimacy of audio with the concise, quality content offered by <span class="italics">i</span>, I would propose a weekly instalment of pithy 10 minute podcasts, briefly outlining and scrutinising a relevant topic. This would be a compelling way to cover the Awards seasons. During the build-up to the Oscars, for example, two film experts could debate the merits, and downfalls, of nominated films.</li>

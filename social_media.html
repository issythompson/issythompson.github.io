	      <h3>iArts Instagram channel</h3>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>Instagram has been instrumental in launching and developing Vanity Fair UK’s website. Visually establishing our identity, and encouraging existing users to engage with content, it has also connected countless non-readers with our wider brand. Consequently, I would establish an iArts Instagram channel which, beyond driving readers to both the print and digital arms of the publication, would significantly widen the breadth of i’s Arts coverage. </li>
	      	<li>Posting morning and evening to catch commuters, every story produced by the Arts desk would be supported by an Instagram picture. In addition to supplementing existing content, I would create condensed, digestible, Instagram-only interviews which, accompanied by a video where possible, would be roughly 300 words in length. I am already experimenting with this at Vanity Fair. For example, in anticipation of his upcoming performance in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at the Old Vic, Daniel Radcliffe is appearing in a short, exclusive video for our Instagram channel. Beyond their utility (these pieces are convenient when there is no capacity for a traditional feature or interview), the bespoke posts would instil i’s social media identity with a sense of authenticity, originality and intrigue. As users are becoming visually fatigued, this is increasingly important.</li>
	      	<li>Instagram videos are effective, but demand time and resources. At Vanity Fair, in response to this challenge, I have initiated a series of editorial partnerships, with the aim of collaboratively producing content for social media. Recently, I formed a partnership with Mario Testino’s team: they provide footage and images from his shoots, and we integrate the content editorially. I would recreate this structure at i, working with cultural institutions who have the means, and the motivation, to produce short videos to showcase their upcoming projects. An example of the content I hope to produce is demonstrated by an upcoming project I am working on with the National Theatre, who are creating a set of backstage video clips for Vanity Fair.
</li>

	      <h3>Promoting engagement via WhatsApp</h3>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>Messaging apps mark the next stage in the evolution of social media. Drawing on the rapid growth of mobile, and the predicted decline of email usage, I would establish a WhatsApp connection between i and its readers, readily offering the curated, concise, immediate information that they crave. I would use the service in two ways. Firstly, to send out a weekly WhatsApp newsletter which, a sharp summary of the week in arts, would contain links to key culture stories that have run over the past seven days. Secondly, I would propose a regular WhatsApp Chat Lab, during which readers could engage in intimate, live conversations with a range of cultural figureheads, who could answer questions related to their life and work.</li>
